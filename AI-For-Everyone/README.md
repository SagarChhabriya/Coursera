# Machine Learning vs Data Science

## Machine Learning (ML)
- It's about teaching computers to learn from data, without being programmed explicitly.
- **Example:** A mobile app that predicts the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, etc.
- The system takes input (house details) and gives an output (predicted price) automatically.
- The system runs 24/7 and helps many users at any time.
- In machine learning, you focus on creating software that takes input and produces an output.

## Data Science
- It's about analyzing data to find patterns and insights that help make decisions.
- **Example:** A team looks at housing data and discovers:
  - Houses with more bedrooms cost more, even with the same size.
  - Renovated homes sell for 15% more.
- These insights help businesses make decisions, like whether to build a 2-bedroom or 3-bedroom house for maximum profit, or if renovating a house is worth the investment.
- In data science, you focus on understanding data and drawing conclusions to guide business decisions.

## Differences
- **Machine Learning** leads to a working software system that automatically outputs results based on input.
- **Data Science** focuses on finding patterns and providing insights, which help businesses make smarter decisions.
- The line between the two is not always clear, and terms may be used differently depending on the industry.

## Definitions
- **Machine Learning:** The ability for computers to learn from data without being programmed (Arthur Samuel).
- **Data Science:** The science of getting knowledge and insights from data.
